#### Pre-requisites for building the project:
* Maven, version 3+
* Java JDK 1.8
* This [settings.xml](https://github.com/pentaho/maven-parent-poms/blob/master/maven-support-files/settings.xml) in your <user-home>/.m2 directory

#### Building it

__Build for nightly/release__

All required profiles are activated by the presence of a property named "release".

```
$ mvn clean install -Drelease
```

This will build, unit test, and package the whole project (all of the sub-modules). The artifact will be generated in: ```marketplace/target```

__Build for CI/dev__

The `release` builds will compile the source for production (meaning potential obfuscation and/or uglification). To build without that happening, just eliminate the `release` property.

```
$ mvn clean install
```
